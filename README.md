# C-Programming-Fundamentals
Short C Programs in Dev C++

This repository contains short C programs I developed during my 2nd semester university course, Computer Programming for Engineering Applications. 
Through these programs, I have successfully explored fundamental programming concepts in C Programming Language utilizing Dev C++,
including input and output expressions, data types, selection statements (if..else; switch; and ternary operators), loops(for;while;do..while...), 
arrays, functions (including recursive functions), pointers, and pointer-based array manipulation.
